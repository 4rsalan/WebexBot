        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        
        Looking for **``ciscosparkapi``**?  You are in the right place.  ``ciscosparkapi`` is now ``webexteamssdk``!  It still has all of the native and natural Webex Teams Python functionality that you love and now we have made room for even more functionality to be added in the future.
        
        We will maintain the ``ciscosparkapi`` package (bug fixes, etc.) in the `ciscosparkapi`_ branch of this repository and continue to publish package updates with these fixes to PyPI (through the;nd of 2019). Maintaining the ``ciscosparkapi`` package should keep your code and projects up and running while giving you 12+ months to migrate your code to the new ``webexteamssdk`` library.
        
        *Migration Note:* Migrating should be easy.  The ``WebexTeamsAPI`` class and the Python objects returned by the API calls are nearly identical to their ``CiscoSparkAPI`` predecessors.  Does the word "nearly" scare you?  Here are some specifics:
        
        * The obvious top-level name change from ``CiscoSparkAPI`` to ``WebexTeamsAPI``.
        * ``WebexTeamsAPI``'s API structure: method and attribute names are *identical*.
        * The returned Python objects (now derivatives of an `ImmutableData` base class) are now immutable; so you can use them in sets and as keys in dictionaries.
        * ``WebexTeamsAPI`` converts object attributes that contain data-time strings (like a room's creation date) to Python ``datetime``'s (actually a derived class that has been customized to model the Webex Teams data-time format)
        
        There is also some new functionality under the hood that we will document, communicate, and generally make available in the future.
        
        
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        
        **webexteamssdk** is a *community developed* Python library for working with the Webex Teams APIs.  Our goal is to make working with Webex Teams in Python a *native* and *natural* experience!
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from webexteamssdk import WebexTeamsAPI
        
            api = WebexTeamsAPI()
        
            # Find all rooms that have 'webexteamssdk Demo' in their title
            all_rooms = api.rooms.list()
            demo_rooms = [room for room in all_rooms if 'webexteamssdk Demo' in room.title]
        
            # Delete all of the demo rooms
            for room in demo_rooms:
                api.rooms.delete(room.id)
        
            # Create a new demo room
            demo_room = api.rooms.create('webexteamssdk Demo')
        
            # Add people to the new demo room
            email_addresses = ["test01@cmlccie.com", "test02@cmlccie.com"]
            for email in email_addresses:
                api.memberships.create(demo_room.id, personEmail=email)
        
            # Post a message to the new room, and upload a file
            api.messages.create(demo_room.id, text="Welcome to the room!",
                                files=["https://www.webex.com/content/dam/wbx/us/images/dg-integ/teams_icon.png"])
        
        
        That's more than 6 Webex Teams API calls in less than 23 lines of code (with comments and whitespace), and likely more than that since webexteamssdk handles pagination_ for you automatically!
        
        webexteamssdk makes your life better...  `Learn how!`__
        
        __ Introduction_
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        webexteamssdk does all of this for you:
        
        * Transparently sources your Webex Teams access token from your local environment
        
        * Provides and uses default arguments and settings everywhere possible, so you don't have to think about things like API endpoint URLs, HTTP headers and JSON formats
        
        * Represents all Webex Teams API interactions using native Python tools
        
          * Authentication and Connection to the Webex Teams Cloud ==> **WebexTeamsAPI** "connection object"
        
          * API Calls ==> Hierarchically organized methods underneath the **WebexTeamsAPI** 'Connection Object'
        
          * Returned Data Objects ==> Native Python objects
        
        * **Automatic and transparent pagination!**
        
        * **Automatic rate-limit handling!** *(wait|retry)*
        
        * Multipart encoding and uploading of local files
        
        * Auto-completion in your favorite IDE, descriptive exceptions, and so much more...
